\newglossaryentry{cancer driver mutation}{name={cancer driver mutation},description={A mutation that increases the net growth advantage of a cancer cell* under the specific microenvironmental context encounter \textit{in vivo} in humans. *=cancer driver mutations may occur prior to a cell clone officially becoming cancer and has the theoretical possibility that the mutation is no longer advantageous for the cancer cell at a later time. However, a cancer driver mutation should be advantageous at least at certain parts towards the development or progression of cancer}}

\newglossaryentry{microenvironment}{name={microenvironment},description={The local environment surrounding and within the tumor}}

\newglossaryentry{pan-cancer}{name={pan-cancer},description={An analysis considering all or many types of cancer together}}

\newglossaryentry{driver mutation}{name={driver mutation},description={Shorthand for cancer driver mutation}}

\newglossaryentry{cancer driver gene}{name={cancer driver gene},description={A gene that contains at least one cancer driver mutation}}

\newglossaryentry{cancer drivers}{name={cancer drivers },description={A genetic loci that contains driver mutations, without reference specifically to whether it is a gene, region, or a mutation}}

\newglossaryentry{intra-tumor heterogeneity}{name={intra-tumor heterogeneity},description={Heterogeneity among cells within a tumor. Here, specifically referring to different usage of cancer driver mutations}}

\newglossaryentry{OG}{name={OG},description={oncogene}}

\newglossaryentry{oncogene}{name={oncogene},description={A cancer driver gene that is activated upon a driver mutation}}

\newglossaryentry{TSG}{name={TSG},description={tumor suppressor gene}}

\newglossaryentry{tumor suppressor gene}{name={tumor suppressor gene},description={A cancer driver gene that is inactivated upon a driver mutation}}

\newglossaryentry{somatic mutation}{name={somatic mutation},description={starting from embryogenesis, mutations that occur in the cells of the body (excluding germ cells), and therefore are not inherited}}

\newglossaryentry{random forest}{name={random forest},description={A supervised machine learning algorithm consisting of an ensemble of randomized decision trees}}

\newglossaryentry{decision tree}{name={decision tree},description={A decision tree is a set of questions asked recursively (in a tree-like manner) to predict either a categorical value (classification) or continuous value (regression)}}

\newglossaryentry{mutation hotspot}{name={mutation hotspot},description={A genomic or protein loci with highly localized mutations}}
